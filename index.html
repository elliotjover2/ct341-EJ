            DeepScribe is used by more than 400 physicians and just raised $30
            million to reach even more. The company’s AI-powered platform helps
            doctors keep better notes by automatically transcribing
            conversations with patients. To expand its market and reach more
            doctors, the company turned to venture capital and eventually
            connected with Nina Achadjian at Index Ventures, who led the $30
            million round.

          <p>
            On the next episode of TCL, DeepScribe’s co-founder and CEO Akilesh
            Bapu will lay out its fundraising strategy, including why Index
            Ventures is a good partner for DeepScribe. Click to register for
